    Object Instancing
    If a complex object is used repeatedly in a scene, object instancing may be worthwhile; this lets the system store a single instance of the object in memory and just record multiple transformations to place it in the scene. Object instances are created via named objects.

    To create a named object, its definition should be placed within an ObjectBegin/ObjectEnd pair:

    ObjectBegin "name"
    Shape ...
    Shape ...
    ObjectEnd

    When a named object is defined, the current transformation matrix defines the transformation from object space to the instance's coordinate space.

    After a named object has been defined, it can be instantiated with the ObjectInstance directive. The current transformation matrix then defines the world from instance space transformation; thus, the final transformation for a shape in an object instance definition is the composition of the CTM when the instance was defined and the CTM when the instance was instantiated.

    Thus, two instances of an object named "foo" are instantiated in the following:

    ObjectInstance "foo"
    Translate 1 0 0
    ObjectInstance "foo"

    Note that the materials that are active when a shape is specified in an instance definition are used when the instance is used; it is not possibility specify different materials for different uses of the same instance.
